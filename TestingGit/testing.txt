. Git helps you to manage your work and never worry about backups again, and there・s a ton of great code on Github so you don・t have to reinvent the wheel over and over again. Oh, and please do code reviews with your peers. Don・t ever use code to analyse data that no-one has read but you (I can・t even believe I even have to tell you this, younger self. You・ve always been a good programmer, but the mistakes I still make that would go unnoticed if it wasn・t for code reviews makes me believe that 30% of all results in science are probably bogus because of bugs).
